Education
======
* BSc Mathematics, University of Sheffield Sheffield, 2023

Research experience
======

  
* Summer Undergraduate Research Experience, Jun 2022
  * University of Sheffield
  * Funded 6-week long Summer Undergraduate Research Internship in Algebraic Topology under the supervision
of Prof Sarah Whitehouse
  * This project (the title was ‘Loops and Covers’) looked at covers of spaces and developed an approach to the Van
Kampen's theorem via the theory of covers.

Conferences and workshops
======
* [2023 International Summer School of Algebraic Geometry](https://scms.fudan.edu.cn/info/4503/5820.htm), 10 - 21 Jul 21, 2023
  * Shanghai Center for Mathematical Sciences
  * This summer school invited a number of international experts in algebraic geometry to give a short course on moduli space theory. The topics include algebraic K-stability, moduli spaces over derived categories, and the P = W conjecture.
    
*[LMS Undergraduate Summer School 2022](http://www.lms.macs.hw.ac.uk/),15 - 26 August, 2022
 * Heriot-Watt University and University of Edinburgh
 * Annual two-week courses held by LMS every Summer at a UK university. The aim is to introduce modern
mathematics to the best UK undergraduates who will enter their final year the following Autumn, and encourage
them to think about an academic career in maths. The LMS Undergraduate Summer School consists of a
combination of short lecture courses with problem-solving sessions and colloquium-style talks from leading
mathematicians. 50 places are available to students per year.

*[AMS-EMS-SMF 2022](https://ams-ems-smf2022.inviteo.fr/), 18 - 22 July, 2022
 *Université Grenoble Alpes
 *The 2nd Joint Congress of Mathematics co-organized by the American Mathematical Society, the European
Mathematical Society and the Société Mathématique de France
