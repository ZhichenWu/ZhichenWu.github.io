Education
======
+* BSc Mathematics, University of Sheffield Sheffield, 2023

Research experience
======
+* [2023 International Summer School of Algebraic Geometry](https://scms.fudan.edu.cn/info/4503/5820.htm), Jul 10 - Jul 21, 2023
  * Shanghai Center for Mathematical Sciences
  * This summer school invited a number of international experts in algebraic geometry to give a short course on moduli space theory. The topics include algebraic K-stability, moduli spaces over derived categories, and the P = W conjecture.
  
+* Summer Undergraduate Research Experience, Jun 2022
  * University of Sheffield
  * Funded 6-week long Summer Undergraduate Research Internship in Algebraic Topology under the supervision
of Prof Sarah Whitehouse
  * This project (the title was ‘Loops and Covers’) looked at covers of spaces and developed an approach to the Van
Kampen's theorem via the theory of covers.
